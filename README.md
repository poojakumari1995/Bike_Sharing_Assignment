Bike Sharing Assignment
Overview
Welcome to the Bike Sharing Assignment repository! This project is dedicated to analyzing a bike sharing dataset to understand patterns and trends in bike rentals. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling, we aim to gain insights into factors influencing bike usage and develop a model to predict future bike rental demand.

Key Objectives
Data Exploration: Investigate the bike sharing dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution of data.
Feature Engineering: Create new features and preprocess existing ones to improve the predictive modeling process.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze relationships between variables, visualize trends, and identify patterns in bike rental data.
Predictive Modeling: Develop machine learning models to predict bike rental demand based on various features such as weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week.
Evaluation: Assess the performance of the predictive models using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques.
Folder Structure
data: Contains the raw bike sharing dataset.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, visualization, feature engineering, and modeling.
reports: Documentation including the final report detailing the EDA process, modeling approach, and evaluation results.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
Pandas, NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical computations.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Tools for data visualization.
Scikit-learn: Library for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for data analysis and documentation.
